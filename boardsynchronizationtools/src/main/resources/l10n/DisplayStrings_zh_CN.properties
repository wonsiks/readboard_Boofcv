# In Java 8 or before, the encoding of the resource bundle files has no standards.
# To avoid encoding inconsistencies, it is recommended to use "native2ascii" tool in JDK
# to encode native translations in raw unicode codes, such as u001 u002 if the native strings
# cannot be encoded in ascii. Typically east Asian translations, such as Chinese(both simplified and traditional),
# Korean or Japanese, need the encoding process.
